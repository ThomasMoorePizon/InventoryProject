# InventoryProject
Final Project
We wanted to start working with GUIs and Databases. This project creates a new database, opens a database, view the tables in a database, create tables, open tables, delete tables, view products in tables, add products to tables, delete products from tables, view the current inventory and update that inventory. We use the sqlite3 and widgets libraries.
